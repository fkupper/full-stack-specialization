## Setup ##

By the end of week 4 of the 2nd module, all external css and js packages are not included because [bower](https://bower.io/) is now taking care of it. 

To be able to use bower, **first install node.js and npm** and run `$ npm install -g bower`to install bower.

Then, before running the project, yout have to **use bower to downloads all deps**. Inside conFusion folder, run:

    $ bower install
  

All dependencies of the frontend should be downloaded.

You are good to go!
